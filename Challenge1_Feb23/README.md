Programming Challenge 1
=======================

## Welcome

Welcome to the first programming challenge for the Programming Committee at the TCC Stem Center.

If you are completely new to python, please checkout [python.org/about/gettingstarted](https://www.python.org/about/gettingstarted/).

Otherwise, you can refer to the [docs](https://docs.python.org/3/) or use a search engine if you have trouble with a challenge.

## The Challenge

* Create a program that, when run, displays a random joke on the screen.

#### Expert Level

* If you think this challenge is too easy, then as an extra challenge, try to create a program that can parse a website that contains
  a list of jokes, and print a random joke from the website.


## Getting Setup

If you need help getting set up in python, please talk to Dylan or someone familiar with python.

The easiest solution is to use (repl.it)[https://repl.it/] (note that you need to make an account) or (pythonfiddle.com)[http://pythonfiddle.com/]

The best approach (especially if you are very interested in programming) is to download python 3 from (python.org)[https://www.python.org/] so that you can run the programs in a terminal, or if you are not terminal-oriented, you can refer to (slant.co)[https://www.slant.co/topics/366/~best-python-ides] for the best python IDEs, which make it really easy to run develop python scripts and execute them.

## Good Luck!

I wish you the best of luck! If you have any questions, don't hesitate to email Dylan at «(dylnmc@gmail.com)[mailto:dylnmc@gmail.com]» or just ask him when he's around.

~ cheers
