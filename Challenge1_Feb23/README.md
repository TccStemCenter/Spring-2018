Programming Challenge 1
=======================

## Welcome

Welcome to the first programming challenge for the Programming Committee at the TCC Stem Center.

If you are completely new to python, please checkout [python.org/about/gettingstarted](https://www.python.org/about/gettingstarted/).

Otherwise, you can refer to the [docs](https://docs.python.org/3/) or use a search engine if you have trouble with a challenge.

## The Challenge

#### Beginner

* Create a random joke generator.
    - When run, your program should print one random joke to the screen.

#### Intermediate

* Create a small web parser that grabs a joke from a joke website and print it to the screen.
    - When run, your program should pull down a website that contains some jokes, parse a joke or list of jokes from that website, and print a randomly selected joke to the screen.

## Getting Setup

The easiest solution is to use [repl.it](https://repl.it/) (note that you need to make an account) or [pythonfiddle.com](http://pythonfiddle.com/)

The best approach (especially if you are very interested in programming) is to download python 3 from [python.org](https://www.python.org/) so that you can run the programs in a terminal, or if you are not terminal-oriented, you can refer to [slant.co](https://www.slant.co/topics/366/~best-python-ides) for the best python IDEs, which make it really easy to run develop python scripts and execute them.

## Good Luck!

I wish you the best of luck! If you have any questions, don't hesitate to email Dylan at dylnmc@gmail.com.
