Spring 2018 Programming Challenges
==================================

### Programming Committee at TCC Stem Center

Welcome to the TCC STEM Center.

Below are challenges to help you get better at programming! Good luck, and let's get programming!

## Challenges

1. [Programming Challenge 1 - Random Joke Generator](https://github.com/TccStemCenter/Spring-2018/tree/master/Challenge1_Feb23/)
2. [Programming Challenge 2 - Sine Wave and Graphing Calculator](https://github.com/TccStemCenter/Spring-2018/tree/master/Challenge2_Mar30)

## How it Works

The Challenges above will be issued once every other week.

Each challenge has two parts:

- __Beginner Challenge__: suitable for novice programmers
- __Expert Challenge__: an addition to the beginner challenge to try even the best programmers :)

On every other Friday, the challenges will be released, and you may choose to attempt the challenge at any point during the week.

If you need any help, feel free to ask Dylan or another committee member for help, or you can email dylnmc@gmail.com.

The solutions will be posted one week after the challenge is published so that can verify your solution. An additional walk-through video will be published with each challenge in case you get stuck. You should watch the videos, as they will give an in-depth overview as to how to solve the challenges, and can help you improve your coding. At the very least, you may learn something new.


## Things to Keep in Mind

1. Programming is Fun
    * This may sound silly, but it is important to keep in mind when you're getting
      frustrated because your program does not work as expected.

2. Programming is Useful
    * Even if you are not planning on getting a Computer Science or a Computer
      Engineering degree, programming is a very useful thing to be aware of, as
      it finds its way into each and every field that you can think of.
    * This Programming Committee has been designed to accomodate not only novice
      programmers or expert programmers, but rather has been carefully constructed
      to accomodate novices—including those who, perhaps, do not want to be a
      programmer but are curious as to how it works—as well as intermediate to
      somewhat expert users.

3. Be Creative and Experiment
    * Even with a very simple program, you can create a very intriguing, useful,
      or really enjoyable/fun program. Ingenuity is key here, as most of the time,
      the only limitation is __you__, the developer!
    * This committee cannot teach you everything about programming, but what it *is*
      designed to do is guide you with each programming challenge and allow you to
      have fun and explore on your own.

4. Learn from Others
    * Explore other projects on github and online
      (__be very wary of downloading and running other peoples' programs__),
      as this is one of the best ways to expose yourself to how others code and some
      of the conventions that exist.

## Have Fun

Even if you don't do every challenge and maybe only do the ones that pique your
interest, I hope that you have fun and learn something new.

If you have any questions, feel free to email Dylan at [dylnmc@gmail.com](mailto:dylnmc@gmail.com).
