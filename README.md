Spring 2018 Programming Challenges
==================================

### challenges

1. [Programming Challenge 1 - Random Joke Generator](https://github.com/TccStemCenter/Spring-2018/tree/master/Challenge1_Feb23/solutions/beginner_challenge_1)

### how it works

* Each folder above will contain a challenge that will be released biweekly.

* Each challenge has a challenge suitable for novice or intermediate programmers
  as well as challenges for those that already have programming exprience

* On every other Friday, the challenges will be released, and you may choose to
  attempt the challenge at any point during the week.
    - If you need any help, feel free to ask Dylan or another committee member
      for help, or you can email dylnmc@gmail.com

* The solutions will be posted one week after the challenge is published so that
  can verify your solution.


### things to keep in mind

1. Programming is Fun
    * This may sound silly, but it is important to keep in mind when you're getting
      frustrated because your program does not work as expected.

2. Programming is Useful
    * Even if you are not planning on getting a Computer Science or a Computer
      Engineering degree, programming is a very useful thing to be aware of, as
      it finds its way into each and every field that you can think of.
    * This Programming Committee has been designed to accomodate not only novice
      programmers or expert programmers, but rather has been carefully constructed
      to accomodate novices—including those who, perhaps, do not want to be a
      programmer but are curious as to how it works—as well as intermediate to
      somewhat expert users.

3. Be Creative and Experiment
    * Even with a very simple program, you can create a very intriguing, useful,
      or really enjoyable/fun program. Ingenuity is key here, as most of the time,
      the only limitation is __you__, the developer!
    * This committee cannot teach you everything about programming, but what it *is*
      designed to do is guide you with each programming challenge and allow you to
      have fun and explore on your own.

4. Learn from Others
    * Explore other projects on github and online
      (__be very wary of downloading and running other peoples' programs__),
      as this is one of the best ways to expose yourself to how others code and some
      of the conventions that exist.

### have fun

Even if you don't do every challenge and maybe only do the ones that pique your
interest, I hope that you have fun and learn something new.

If you have any questions, feel free to email Dylan at «dylnmc@gmail.com».
