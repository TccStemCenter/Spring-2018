Programming Challenge 2
=======================

## The Challenge

#### Beginner

* Create a program that prints out an ascii sine wave and that expects user input (or, optionally, command-line args) that dictate the `amplitude` and `wavelength` of the wave.
    - When run, your program should prompt the user for the `amplitude` and `wavelength` (if not provided in args); then, it should print a sinusoidal wave with the correct amplitude and wavelength, given the user input or args.

#### Intermediate

* Create a simple graphing calculator.
    - When run, your program should expect user input, then it should parse the input and store it into, for example, Reverse Polish Notation (RPN), then graphically display the equation in a Graphical User Interface (GUI).


## Getting Setup

Be sure to download python 3 from [python.org](https://www.python.org/) so that you can run the programs in a terminal. Or, if you're on linux, you can install python with your package manager (for example `aptitude` on Ubuntu).

If you are on Windows or not very terminal-oriented, you can refer to [slant.co](https://www.slant.co/topics/366/~best-python-ides) for the best python IDEs, which make it really easy to run develop python scripts and execute them. For example, you could install [pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=linux), which is one of the most highly recommended python IDEs out there.

## Good Luck!

I wish you the best of luck! If you have any questions, don't hesitate to email Dylan at dylnmc@gmail.com.
